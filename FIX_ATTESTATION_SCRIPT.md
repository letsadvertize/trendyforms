# Fix for Provider Visit Attestation - Immunodeficiency Script

## Problem
The original script had issues with table cell manipulation using `removeCell(1)` operations, which was causing document formatting problems and blank form submissions.

## Solution
The script has been fixed by:

1. **Removed problematic `removeCell(1)` operations** - These were corrupting the document structure
2. **Simplified table layout** - Used proper two-column table structure without manipulation
3. **Improved header formatting** - Removed hardcoded widths that could cause issues
4. **Simplified footer** - Removed complex date formatting that might fail

## Key Changes Made

### Fixed Table Structure
**Before (problematic):**
```javascript
const addressCell = providerRow2.appendTableCell("Address: " + address)
addressCell.setWidth(500)
const addressCell2 = providerRow2.appendTableCell("")
providerRow2.removeCell(1) // ← This was causing issues
```

**After (fixed):**
```javascript
const addressCell = providerRow2.appendTableCell("Address: " + address)
addressCell.setFontSize(11)
addressCell.setPaddingBottom(6)
const addressCell2 = providerRow2.appendTableCell("")
addressCell2.setFontSize(11)
addressCell2.setPaddingBottom(6)
```

### Simplified Header
- Removed hardcoded cell widths
- Used proper table structure
- Maintained professional formatting

### Cleaner Footer
- Removed complex timezone formatting
- Used simpler date/time display
- Added proper spacing

## Expected Result
The form should now generate properly formatted PDFs with all data populated correctly in Google Drive.
